The Olmos pottery named after the towns of Empalme Olmos and Olmos Villa located in the department of Canelones, emerged in the late nineteenth century as a result of the activity of the former workshops of State Railways.

Manufactured by Uruguayan hands, Olmos products are for several a pride for all generations. Innovation, creativity and new colors, many more reasons to enjoy them in the homes of our country and the world.

Olmos' site was trusted to my work. The design work was made by the folks at Lowe Ginkgo (an Advertising Agency) and my part was all about the backend and the frontend applications.

The frontend was made using BackboneJS consuming a rails-powered API on the same server.
