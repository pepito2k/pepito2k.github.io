Just about one year ago, I wanted to check if there was any tool that can show some statistics from a git repository, just for fun, the idea of having a resume of my git log with some charts was a great one for me.

The thing was the only thing I found was a gist from a guy named Tobin Harris which can be [seen here](https://gist.github.com/tobinharris/396634). And I never created a ruby gem before so the idea of porting that to a gem was cool.

After following a few simple steps detailed on rubygems.org website, I had the first version of [Gitalytics](http://gonzalo.robaina.me/gitalytics) working and published to the world.

Some time after that, I received my first Pull Request, I felt so excited I can't just explain here with words. I received the first colaboration on my first open-source project. Somebody took the time to actually read my code, write a fix and send me a pull request. WOW!

Now, I'm working again with Ruby, Rails, Git (I had a year of PHP, Wordpress, Symfony, Javascript and SVN) and I just wanted to give Gitalytics a push, to make it useful for other people and to help me keep learning about Ruby.

Before ending 2013 I started this journey, Gitalytics came from v0.0.1 to v1.1.1 in less than 2 weeks with lots of new features (it grew from showing a few lines on the console to writing a full html report with graphs images and colors!)

The good news is that it seems to have a good look and lots of people now had installed it. It recently achieved the first milestone of 1000 installs and I'm looking forward to make that number go pass the 5000 in the near future.

I never thought of creating something people would star on github, right now it has 14 stargazers. And yesterday I merged 2 pull requests with bug fixes.

Sorry for the long post, if you happen to read this far what I have to say to you is that some time ago I would never thought about writing something open source. Today I can say, **open source is fun**, it helps you learn and maybe, just maybe you can save the day for someone else with your work. Just as lots of other devs are saving yours daily.
