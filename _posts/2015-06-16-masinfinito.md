MasInfinito Casa is a store specialized in selling high quality design furniture such as chairs, tables, couches or even lamps at really accessible prices.

I worked on a small team for this project: one designer, one frontend developer and myself working in the backend development and the integration with the payments processor.

The backend was done with ruby on rails making use of my own Tienda Gem which helps creating an e-commerce administration backend. For the payment processing we relied on the API of PagosWeb, an uruguayan online payment processing company.
