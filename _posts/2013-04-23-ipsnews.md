Information is an agent of change. Since its inception, back in 1964, IPS has believed in the role of information as a precondition for lifting communities out of poverty and marginalization.

Because of its mission and conceptual approach, IPS has grown together with and systematically covered civil society, particularly its increasing international impact. Recognizing the impact of globalization on the South is another crucial insight that influences the way we report, build capacity and disseminate our news. This has made IPS a relevant actor within the overall development process and the main international news provider of organized civil society worldwide.

IPS wanted to move from their custom ASP former site and administration to a more globally recognized and reliable CMS as it is Wordpress.

They trusted in my knowledge for this work and I must say it was a very challenging project because of the enormous quantity of visits that the site gets every day. Having to explore and analyze several cache tools to allow the site to be available to all the visitors without missing any new content.
